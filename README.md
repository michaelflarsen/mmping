## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Access Denied" when changing IP
- Run application as Administrator
- Windows Firewall or security software might block changes

### Network scan is slow
- Reduce the IP range (e.g., 1-100 instead of 1-254)
- Check your network connectivity
- Try scanning a smaller subnet

### Adapters not showing
- Click "Refresh Adapters"
- Check if adapters are enabled in Device Manager
- Some virtual adapters might not show
